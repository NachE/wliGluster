* Implement all commands from gluster to wliGluster GUI

* Make the interface more user friendly

* Make the code more scalable

* See how to save the permissions problem
   Actually the gluster command can only executed by root. 
   We need to look for a solution to not chmod +S the 
   command or to not exec the server with root.

* Improve the way of update information.
   Now we rewrite all window content to show updated
   data. This need to be improved making a easy way
   to update data without rewriting all interface.
   Maybe coding a widget lib?

* Think if we have to separate the emergent menus and
  their events from core and put it on the theme side.
